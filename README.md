**DO NOT MANUALLY INSTALL THESE; USE [THE SCRIPT](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/cros-keyboard-map) TO INSTALL!**

### How do I install?
Thanks to WeirdTreeThing, you can now do this with a automated tool. You will need `git` if you don't already have it installed.

1.     git clone https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/cros-keyboard-map
2.     cd cros-keyboard-map
3.     ./install.sh

Thanks to rvaiya for creating [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd).
